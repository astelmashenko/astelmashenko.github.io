**Note:** My experience working remotely starts back 2012 when I started working for an US based company. Since then I worked only remotely, so it is now (2024) about 12+ years of experience.

There are obious advantages, like cost and time savings, flexible working day, etc. And of course disadvantages: isolation, communication and the most important I see 
is work-life boundaries.

But let's talk on specific advices how to make it comfortable and effective.

1. **Time management:** because you become more flexible, it's easy to split your working day, especially if timezones with your client are different. 
The dangerouse thing is to stay effective, if you split your working day in more then 2 parts then it's likely you will not be able to do big enough tasks which require 
long focus, thus you become ineffective. Another important thing is to think about the next day, especially if there is big difference between timezones. You need to 
double check email/chat so there are no important questions and you do not block anybody, check tasks details and ask all questions beforehand, so you are not blocked as well!

2. **Work-Life Boundaries:** 

* Your working place is so close, so you can miss when you are at work again, working 9th and 10th hour! It's very dangerouse, because can 
lead to burndown and consequences! At the end of working day switch off everything related to work, of couse there is personal email or phone left (which should be rarely
used to reach out to you only in urgent situations). You should be able to say "NO", teach yourself to say "NO", you have personal life and it's even more importnat then 
any project.

* As well keep work out of reach in your personal time, you should teach your friends/family that you are actually at work, and believe me switching context is very expensive
operation in real life (not only in operating systems), it will exhuast you very quickly.

3. **Communication skills:** few points here

* If you ever tried to work on open source project then you should know, if you write a poor question, nobody will spend their time to get details,
you will be just ignored.Take time and write thoughtful answers or emails. This will save your and colleagues time. 

* Chat and email are different levels. Email make it official, and easy to escalate thing. Chat like Slack is (and should be) less official. Never accpept work in slack,
where it is so easy to delete what was written, when you feel like conversation takes time or becomes important, escalate it to a ticket, eamil or meeting.

* Be visible, when you are not working, keep proper status; when somebody asks you something to check, you always can give a short answer, say that you busy or started looking at it.

4. Socialize! When you are working from home, mostly alone then it is very important to talk to people. One more thing which feel different from office is spent time.
To me it's very hard to work 8 pure hours, but it's much easier to do it at home. In an office you will be more often distracted, have a coffee with colleages, etc.

5. Always stay professional.

This applies not only to hiring process, but to you attitude to what you do. You do something not the best you can do it, the first time it is an exception,
the second time it is a regular thing, later you become regular.

And the most important thing: Love what you do!  
If you can not then learn to love and then you will always enjoy it!
